# Hook Test Implementation Summary

## Problem Encountered

When implementing unit tests for the hook system, we discovered a critical issue with test isolation:

1. **Initial Approach**: Used StringIO to mock stdin/stdout and imported hooks directly
2. **Issue**: Tests passed individually but failed when run together
3. **Root Cause**: Python's module import caching and sys module state pollution between tests
4. **Symptoms**: 
   - First test would work correctly
   - Subsequent tests would fail with "No response received"
   - Output was visible in pytest's "Captured stdout" but not in our mock objects

## Solution: Subprocess-Based Testing

We switched to a subprocess-based approach that provides complete isolation:

### Key Benefits:
1. **True Isolation**: Each test runs the hook in a separate process
2. **No State Pollution**: Clean Python interpreter for each hook invocation
3. **Realistic Testing**: Mimics how Claude Code actually calls hooks
4. **100% Pass Rate**: All 16 tests for pre_tool_use.py now pass

### Implementation Details:

```python
# Run hook as subprocess
result = subprocess.run(
    [sys.executable, str(hook_path)],
    input=json.dumps(event_data),
    capture_output=True,
    text=True,
    cwd=str(self.project_dir),
    env={**os.environ, 'PYTHONPATH': str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent)}
)
```

## Test Coverage for pre_tool_use.py

### Core Functionality Tests:
1. ✅ Allows operations when no state file exists
2. ✅ Allows all operations when automation is inactive
3. ✅ Blocks write tools in planning step
4. ✅ Allows read tools in planning step
5. ✅ Allows TodoWrite in planning step
6. ✅ Allows all tools in implementation step

### Emergency Override Tests:
7. ✅ Emergency patterns override workflow restrictions
8. ✅ Various emergency patterns are recognized

### Metrics Tracking Tests:
9. ✅ Metrics update correctly on allow
10. ✅ Metrics update correctly on block
11. ✅ Emergency overrides are tracked in metrics

### Edge Cases:
12. ✅ Invalid event data is handled gracefully
13. ✅ Corrupted state files don't crash the hook

### Workflow-Specific Tests:
14. ✅ Validation step allows Edit but blocks Write
15. ✅ Refinement step allows MultiEdit but blocks Write
16. ✅ Integration step allows git operations

### Isolation Test:
17. ✅ Multiple hook calls maintain proper isolation

## Files Created

1. `/tests/unit/test_hook_base_subprocess.py` - Base class with subprocess isolation
2. `/tests/unit/test_pre_tool_use_subprocess.py` - 16 comprehensive tests
3. `/docs/HOOK_TEST_ISOLATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed isolation strategy
4. `/docs/HOOK_TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Next Steps

1. Implement tests for post_tool_use.py using the same subprocess approach
2. Implement tests for stop.py hook
3. Create unit tests for supporting modules:
   - workflow_rules.py
   - event_validator.py
   - hook_utils.py

## Lessons Learned

1. **Module Import Caching**: Python's import system can cause unexpected test interactions
2. **sys Module State**: Modifying sys.stdin/stdout/stderr affects the global interpreter state
3. **Subprocess Isolation**: Provides the most reliable test isolation for CLI tools
4. **Test First Principles**: When tests behave differently in isolation vs. together, suspect state pollution

## Performance Considerations

- Subprocess tests are slower (~1.35s for 16 tests vs ~0.15s for mock-based)
- Trade-off is worthwhile for reliability and accuracy
- Tests run in parallel would mitigate the performance impact
