# Implementation Plan: Build Missing Automated Phase-Driven Development System

## OVERVIEW

Build the complete automated phase-driven development system described in docs/PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md, bridging the gap between documentation and reality. This system will provide Claude Code hooks, project state management, and automated workflow execution.

## ARCHITECTURE FOUNDATION

```
Current State:               Target State:
- Test framework only        - Full automation system
- Template commands          - Working commands
- Mock state references      - Real state management
- No hooks                   - Claude Code integration
```

## PHASE 1: STATE MANAGEMENT CORE

### 1.1 Project State Schema Design
- Create comprehensive .project-state.json schema
- Fields: current_phase, workflow_step, current_objective, automation_active, quality_gates, progress_tracking, timestamps, git_info
- Define state transitions between phases and workflow steps
- Add validation rules and error handling specifications

### 1.2 StateManager Class Implementation
- Create src/state_manager.py with core operations:
  - create(): Initialize new project state
  - read(): Load and validate existing state
  - update(): Atomic state updates with validation
  - validate(): Schema and business rule validation
  - transition_phase(): Controlled phase transitions
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging integration
- Include atomic file operations for reliability

### 1.3 State Integration
- Update scripts/logged_secure_shell.py to use StateManager
- Create state utilities for common operations
- Add state backup and recovery mechanisms
- Integrate with existing logging architecture

**Success Criteria:** StateManager can create, read, update project state reliably. All existing code using state references works with real implementation.

## PHASE 2: COMMAND IMPLEMENTATION

### 2.1 Git Worktree Operations
- Create src/git_operations.py for worktree management
- Implement safe worktree creation, validation, cleanup
- Add git branch operations and remote tracking
- Include safety checks and error recovery

### 2.2 Project Structure Creation  
- Create src/project_builder.py for directory setup
- Generate phase files from templates
- Create CLAUDE.md, .claude/settings.json
- Set up logging directories and configuration

### 2.3 Command Scripts Implementation
Convert template commands to working implementations:

**setup.md → src/commands/setup.py**
- Git worktree creation and validation
- Project structure generation
- Initial state file creation
- Safety checks and rollback capability

**start.md → src/commands/start.py**
- State transition from "setup" to "active"
- Hook activation sequence
- Validation of project readiness

**status.md → src/commands/status.py**
- Comprehensive status reporting
- Progress visualization
- Quality gate status display

**pause.md, resume.md, stop.md → src/commands/lifecycle.py**
- Automation control operations
- State persistence during transitions
- Clean shutdown procedures

### 2.4 Command Integration
- Update install.sh to install Python commands
- Create command wrapper scripts for Claude Code integration
- Add error handling and user feedback
- Test manual operation mode

**Success Criteria:** All /user:project:* commands work manually. Projects can be created, managed, and monitored without automation.

## PHASE 3: HOOK INTEGRATION

### 3.1 Claude Code Hook Research
- Research Claude Code hook API and capabilities
- Identify hook types: PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop
- Understand hook installation and activation
- Document limitations and requirements

### 3.2 Workflow Automation Engine
- Create src/automation_engine.py for workflow control
- Implement 6-step workflow state machine:
  1. Planning → Implementation → Validation → Review → Refinement → Integration
- Add quality gate enforcement
- Create workflow step validation logic

### 3.3 Hook Implementation
**PreToolUse Hook (src/hooks/pre_tool_use.py)**
- Validate operations align with current workflow step
- Prevent unauthorized actions during specific phases
- Log operation attempts and decisions

**PostToolUse Hook (src/hooks/post_tool_use.py)**
- Update progress based on tool usage
- Validate quality gates after operations
- Trigger workflow step transitions

**Stop Hook (src/hooks/stop.py)**
- Continue 6-step workflow on session end
- Preserve context and current position
- Queue next workflow steps

### 3.4 Hook Integration
- Create .claude/settings.json templates with hook configuration
- Add hook installation to setup command
- Implement hook activation/deactivation
- Add automation monitoring and control

**Success Criteria:** Claude Code follows 6-step workflow automatically. Quality gates prevent progression without validation. Automation can be paused/resumed reliably.

## PHASE 4: TESTING & VALIDATION

### 4.1 Unit Testing
- Test StateManager with comprehensive edge cases
- Test command implementations in isolation  
- Test git operations with various scenarios
- Mock hook API for automation engine testing

### 4.2 Integration Testing
- Add project management tests to existing 4-layer framework
- Test complete workflow from setup to completion
- Validate state persistence across operations
- Test error recovery and rollback scenarios

### 4.3 System Testing
- Create test projects with real Claude Code integration
- Validate automation in controlled environment
- Test hook behavior with various tool usage patterns
- Performance testing with complex projects

### 4.4 Safety Validation
- Test git worktree isolation effectiveness
- Validate --dangerously-skip-permissions safety measures
- Test rollback and recovery procedures
- Validate state corruption recovery

**Success Criteria:** Complete system tested and validated. All edge cases handled. Performance acceptable. Safety measures effective.

## PHASE 5: DOCUMENTATION & POLISH

### 5.1 Documentation Alignment
- Update docs/PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md to reflect actual implementation
- Create comprehensive user guide and troubleshooting
- Document hook API integration details
- Add architecture diagrams and workflow visualizations

### 5.2 User Experience Polish
- Improve command output and progress indicators
- Add helpful error messages and recovery suggestions
- Create setup validation and diagnostic tools
- Add configuration options for different project types

### 5.3 Advanced Features
- Multi-project support and project switching
- Custom workflow definitions beyond 6-step default
- Integration with external tools and services
- Performance optimizations and caching

**Success Criteria:** System is production-ready, well-documented, and provides excellent user experience. Matches all documented capabilities.

## IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE

```
Phase 1: StateManager → Commands depend on state
Phase 2: Commands → Hooks depend on working commands  
Phase 3: Hooks → Testing requires all components
Phase 4: Testing → Documentation requires validated system
Phase 5: Polish → Final deliverable
```

## CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES

1. **Claude Code Hook API Access** - Must validate feasibility early in Phase 3
2. **Git Worktree Behavior** - Must test thoroughly in Phase 2
3. **Existing Test Framework** - Must integrate without breaking current functionality
4. **State File Reliability** - Must ensure atomic operations in Phase 1

## RISK MITIGATION

- **Hook API Risk:** Build complete manual system first, layer automation on top
- **Complexity Risk:** Incremental implementation with working system at each phase
- **Integration Risk:** Extensive testing with existing codebase
- **User Experience Risk:** Early validation and feedback incorporation

## DELIVERABLES SUMMARY

- Complete project state management system
- Working /user:project:* command implementation  
- Claude Code hook integration for automation
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Production-ready documentation and user experience

This plan transforms the documented vision into a working automated development system while maintaining the robustness of the existing test framework.
