# Implementation Plan: Build Missing Automated Sprint-Driven Development System

## OVERVIEW

Build the complete automated sprint-driven development system described in docs/PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md, bridging the gap between documentation and reality. This system will provide Claude Code hooks, project state management, and automated workflow execution.

## CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE UPDATE

Recent analysis revealed the current implementation fundamentally misunderstood Claude Code's architecture. The solution requires a three-layer approach:

1. **Commands**: Simple markdown triggers (10-20 lines) with YAML frontmatter
2. **Hooks**: Python scripts that enforce workflows and manage state
3. **StateManager**: Already built in Sprint 1, provides persistence

## ARCHITECTURE FOUNDATION

```
Current State:               Target State:
- Test framework only        - Full automation system
- 300+ line command files    - 20-line command triggers
- No hook usage              - Hooks enforce workflows
- Manual instructions        - Automated enforcement
- No state management        - StateManager integration
```

## PHASE 1: STATE MANAGEMENT CORE ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### 1.1 Project State Schema Design
- Create comprehensive .project-state.json schema
- Fields: current_sprint, workflow_step, current_user story, automation_active, quality_gates, progress_tracking, timestamps, git_info
- Define state transitions between sprints and workflow steps
- Add validation rules and error handling specifications

### 1.2 StateManager Class Implementation
- Create src/state_manager.py with core operations:
  - create(): Initialize new project state
  - read(): Load and validate existing state
  - update(): Atomic state updates with validation
  - validate(): Schema and business rule validation
  - transition_sprint(): Controlled sprint transitions
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging integration
- Include atomic file operations for reliability

### 1.3 State Integration
- Update scripts/logged_secure_shell.py to use StateManager
- Create state utilities for common operations
- Add state backup and recovery mechanisms
- Integrate with existing logging architecture

**Success Criteria:** StateManager can create, read, update project state reliably. All existing code using state references works with real implementation.

## PHASE 2: COMMAND IMPLEMENTATION (REVISED)

### 2.1 Command Architecture Redesign
**Problem**: Current commands are 300+ line instruction manuals
**Solution**: Rewrite as simple 10-20 line markdown triggers

### 2.2 Command File Structure
Each command must have:
- YAML frontmatter with `allowed-tools` declaration
- Direct shell execution with `!` prefix
- Minimal logic (complex logic moves to hooks)

Example structure:
```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(echo:*), Bash(jq:*), Bash(python3:*)
description: Start project automation
---

Start automated development for this project.

!`[ -f ".project-state.json" ] || { echo "‚ùå No project found"; exit 1; }`
!`python3 -c "from state_manager import StateManager; StateManager('.').update({'status': 'active', 'automation_active': True})"`

Automation activated. I'll now follow the story lifecycle.
```

### 2.3 Commands to Rewrite

**setup.md** (20 lines max)
- Signal to create project structure
- Let hooks handle complex logic

**start.md** (15 lines max)
- Update state to active
- Enable automation flag

**status.md** (20 lines max)
- Display current state
- Show workflow position

**pause.md** (15 lines max)
- Set paused state
- Disable automation

**resume.md** (15 lines max)
- Restore active state
- Re-enable automation

**stop.md** (15 lines max)
- Finalize project
- Generate summary

### 2.4 Supporting Python Modules
- Keep src/git_operations.py for hook usage
- Keep src/project_builder.py for hook usage
- Commands just trigger, hooks do the work

**Success Criteria:** All /user:project:* commands work manually. Projects can be created, managed, and monitored without automation.

## PHASE 3: HOOK INTEGRATION (CRITICAL PATH)

### 3.1 Hook Architecture
**Key Insight**: Hooks are where the complex logic lives, not commands

Available hooks:
- **PreToolUse**: Block/allow tools based on workflow state
- **PostToolUse**: Update state after tool execution
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Intercept user commands
- **Stop**: Advance workflow steps automatically

### 3.2 Hook Configuration
Create `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": {
      "command": "python3 /path/to/hooks/pre_tool_use.py",
      "timeout": 5000
    },
    "PostToolUse": {
      "command": "python3 /path/to/hooks/post_tool_use.py"
    },
    "Stop": {
      "command": "python3 /path/to/hooks/stop.py"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.3 Hook Implementations

**PreToolUse Hook (src/hooks/pre_tool_use.py)**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import sys
from state_manager import StateManager

def main():
    event = json.loads(sys.stdin.read())
    state = StateManager(event['cwd']).read()
    
    # Workflow enforcement
    if state['workflow_step'] == 'planning':
        if event['tool'] in ['Write', 'Edit']:
            print(json.dumps({
                "allow": False,
                "message": "üö´ Planning sprint: Complete analysis first"
            }))
            return
    
    print(json.dumps({"allow": True}))
```

**PostToolUse Hook (src/hooks/post_tool_use.py)**
- Track acceptance criteria completion
- Update files modified list
- Record test results

**Stop Hook (src/hooks/stop.py)**
- Check if current step complete
- Advance to next workflow step
- Reset acceptance criteria for new step

### 3.4 Workflow State Machine
Implement in hooks, not separate engine:
1. **Planning**: Research only, no coding
2. **Implementation**: Allow code writing
3. **Validation**: Require tests before proceeding
4. **Review**: Trigger code review
5. **Refinement**: Address review feedback
6. **Integration**: Final checks and commit

**Success Criteria:** Claude Code follows story lifecycle automatically. Quality gates prevent progression without validation. Automation can be paused/resumed reliably.

## EXAMPLE WORKFLOW: "Fix Product Build" Sprint

Let's trace through a complete workflow to show how commands and hooks interact:

### Initial State
```json
{
  "project_name": "e-commerce-platform",
  "current_sprint": "03-fix-build",
  "status": "active",
  "automation_active": true,
  "workflow_step": "planning",
  "current_user story": "Fix product build compilation errors"
}
```

### Workflow Execution

**1. Planning Stage**
- User: "Fix the product build errors"
- PreToolUse: Allows Read, Grep; blocks Write, Edit
- Claude: Analyzes build logs, identifies root cause
- Stop Hook: Detects planning complete ‚Üí advances to "implementation"

**2. Implementation Stage**
- PreToolUse: Now allows Write, Edit
- Claude: Fixes src/products/builder.py, config.yaml
- PostToolUse: Tracks modified files
- Stop Hook: Files modified ‚Üí advances to "validation"

**3. Validation Stage**
- Claude: Runs build, tests
- PostToolUse: Marks "compilation", "existing_tests" gates
- PreToolUse: Blocks commit until new tests written
- Stop Hook: All tests pass ‚Üí advances to "review"

**4. Review Stage**
- Claude: Uses zen code review
- PostToolUse: Marks "review" gate, captures findings
- Stop Hook: Review complete ‚Üí advances to "refinement"

**5. Refinement Stage**
- Claude: Addresses review feedback
- PostToolUse: Tracks refinements
- Stop Hook: Issues resolved ‚Üí advances to "integration"

**6. Integration Stage**
- Claude: Updates docs, final tests, commits
- PostToolUse: Marks final gates
- Stop Hook: Objective complete ‚Üí resets to "planning" for next task

### Key Insights
- Commands are simple triggers
- Hooks enforce the entire workflow
- State drives all behavior
- Automatic progression through stages
- Quality gates enforced at each step
