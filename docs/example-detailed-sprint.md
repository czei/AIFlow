# Sprint 03: Implementation

## Status: IN_PROGRESS
## Started: 2025-07-21T09:00:00Z  
## Last Updated: 2025-07-21T15:30:00Z
## Completion: 62% (5 of 8 user stories)

## Prerequisites: 
- [x] Sprint 02 (Architecture) COMPLETE
- [x] Database schema finalized
- [x] API specifications defined
- [x] Development environment configured
- [x] Testing framework set up

## Objectives:
- [x] Database layer implementation 
- [x] User authentication system
- [x] Core API endpoints (users, auth)
- [ ] Business logic API endpoints (3 of 6 complete)
- [ ] Error handling and validation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Integration tests

## Implementation Workflow (Per Objective)

For each user story above, follow this detailed workflow:

### 1. Planning Step
- Review current user story and acceptance criteria
- Break down into specific implementation tasks
- Identify dependencies and potential blockers
- Estimate effort and complexity
- Plan testing approach for this user story

### 2. Implementation Step  
- Write code following project coding standards
- Implement core functionality first
- Add error handling and edge case management
- Include inline documentation and comments
- Follow established architecture patterns

### 3. Validation Step
- **Compile Check**: Ensure code compiles without errors
- **Unit Tests**: Run existing unit tests to prevent regressions
- **New Tests**: Write unit tests for new functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Run relevant integration tests
- **Manual Testing**: Basic smoke testing of new functionality
- **Code Quality**: Check for code smells and adherence to standards

### 4. Review Step
- **Self Review**: Review own code for obvious issues
- **Zen Code Review**: Submit to zen methodology for comprehensive review
  - Focus on: logic correctness, edge cases, performance, security
  - Check: code organization, naming, documentation quality
  - Validate: test coverage, error handling completeness
- **Documentation Review**: Ensure code changes are properly documented

### 5. Refinement Step  
- **Implement Review Feedback**: Address all issues identified in code review
- **Re-run Tests**: Execute full test suite after changes
- **Regression Testing**: Verify no existing functionality broken
- **Performance Check**: Basic performance validation if relevant
- **Final Validation**: Confirm user story fully meets acceptance criteria

### 6. Integration Step
- **Merge Preparation**: Ensure branch is ready for integration
- **Documentation Update**: Update API docs, README, or other project docs
- **Commit Creation**: Create clean, descriptive commit messages
- **Progress Update**: Mark user story complete and update project state

## Success Criteria for Each Objective:
- [ ] Code compiles without warnings or errors
- [ ] All existing unit tests continue to pass  
- [ ] New unit tests written with >90% coverage of new code
- [ ] Integration tests pass for affected components
- [ ] Code review completed with all issues addressed
- [ ] Performance meets established benchmarks
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect changes
- [ ] Manual testing confirms expected behavior

## Sprint Completion Criteria:
- All user stories marked complete following full workflow
- Comprehensive integration test suite passing
- Code review completed for all new code  
- Performance benchmarks met or exceeded
- API documentation complete and accurate
- No known bugs or critical issues remaining

## Acceptance Criteria:
Each user story must pass these gates before being marked complete:
1. **Compilation Gate**: Code builds successfully
2. **Test Gate**: All tests pass including new ones
3. **Review Gate**: Code review completed and issues resolved
4. **Integration Gate**: Works correctly with existing system
5. **Documentation Gate**: All changes properly documented

## Automation Instructions for Claude:
When working on this sprint:
1. Always follow the story lifecycle for each user story
2. Do not mark user stories complete until all success criteria met
3. Run full test suite before and after each user story
4. Submit each user story to zen code review before completion
5. Update progress notes with specific validation results
6. If any quality gate fails, resolve issues before proceeding
7. Ask for human intervention if stuck on validation failures

## Current Focus: Business Logic API Endpoints
**Next Objective**: Payment processing endpoint
**Workflow Position**: Planning step  
**Estimated Completion**: 2-3 hours including full workflow
**Dependencies**: Payment service integration configured
**Risk Factors**: External payment API rate limits during testing
