# AIFlow

A comprehensive sprint-based development system with automated workflow enforcement, state management, and advanced testing framework. Currently achieving **100% test pass rate** with all core functionality operational.

## Current Status (Phase 3 - Testing & Validation)

âœ… **Core Functionality**: 100% operational  
âœ… **Test Suite**: 100% pass rate (19/19 tests)  
âœ… **State Management**: Atomic operations with validation  
âœ… **Hook System**: Workflow enforcement with intelligent rules  
âœ… **Command System**: All 10 commands implemented  
ðŸ”„ **Next**: Hook system test coverage (currently 0%)

## Key Components

- **StateManager**: Atomic state operations with comprehensive validation
- **Hook System**: Pre/Post tool use hooks with workflow enforcement
- **MockClaudeProvider**: Deterministic AI simulation for testing
- **LoggedSecureShell**: Security-focused command execution with structured logging

## Available Commands

After installation, these commands will be available in any Claude Code session:

- `/user:project:setup <project-name>` - Create new project worktree and structure
- `/user:project:doctor` - Validate project setup and workflow configuration
- `/user:project:start` - Begin automated sprint-based development
- `/user:project:status` - Show comprehensive project progress and workflow state
- `/user:project:pause` - Temporarily pause automation
- `/user:project:resume` - Resume automation from exact workflow position
- `/user:project:stop` - End project cleanly with quality summary
- `/user:project:update` - Update project state and objective completion
- `/user:project:advance [sprint]` - Force advancement to next/specific sprint
- `/user:project:sprint <action>` - Manage sprints (list, create, edit, jump)

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to an existing git repository
2. Run: `/user:project:setup my-awesome-project`
3. Customize the generated sprint files for your specific project requirements
4. Review `docs/WORKFLOW_SPECIFICATIONS.md` for detailed workflow methodology
5. Run: `/user:project:doctor` to validate setup
6. Run: `/user:project:start` to begin automated development

## Core Workflow Methodology

The system implements a rigorous **6-step workflow** for every development objective:

1. **Planning** - Context review, task breakdown, risk assessment, approach design
2. **Implementation** - Production-quality code development following standards  
3. **Validation** - Compilation, testing (unit + integration), manual verification, performance check
4. **Review** - Self-review + zen methodology comprehensive code review
5. **Refinement** - Address feedback, re-test, optimize, resolve all issues
6. **Integration** - Final testing, documentation updates, clean commits, progress tracking

### Quality Gates

Each objective must pass these mandatory gates:
- âœ… **Compilation Gate** - Code builds without errors/warnings
- âœ… **Test Gate** - All tests pass + >90% coverage for new code  
- âœ… **Review Gate** - Code review completed with all issues resolved
- âœ… **Integration Gate** - Clean integration with existing system
- âœ… **Documentation Gate** - All changes properly documented
- âœ… **Performance Gate** - Meets established benchmarks

## Important Notes

- **Quality-First Approach**: Every change goes through comprehensive validation
- **Automated Testing**: Built-in unit and integration testing requirements
- **Code Review**: Mandatory zen methodology review for all code
- **Documentation**: Required documentation updates for all changes
- **Performance Validation**: Built-in performance benchmarking
- **Git Worktree Isolation**: Projects run in isolated environments for safety
- **State Persistence**: Complete workflow state tracking and resumability
- **Current Security Model**: Uses `--dangerously-skip-permissions` with git worktree isolation
- **Future Security Enhancement**: OPA-based command validation (see SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Architecture Overview

The system creates comprehensive project structure:
- **Git worktrees** for project isolation and safety
- **Sprint-driven development** with detailed workflow specifications
- **Automated workflow** with Claude Code hooks and quality gates
- **Multi-layered state management** for resumable automation
- **Quality assurance** built into every development step
