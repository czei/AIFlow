# Claude Code Phase-Driven Development System

## Project Overview

This system provides automated, phase-driven development using Claude Code's capabilities to manage long-running software projects with minimal human intervention. It addresses the challenge of maintaining context and momentum across extended development sessions that can span days or weeks.

## Problem Statement

Traditional development with Claude Code suffers from several limitations:
- **Context drift**: Claude loses track of project goals and current position over long sessions
- **Manual overhead**: Developers spend hours repeatedly prompting the same workflow sequences
- **Inconsistent execution**: Without structured guidance, Claude may deviate from planned approaches
- **State management**: No persistent tracking of progress across phases and sessions
- **Quality inconsistency**: No systematic approach to validation, testing, and code review

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Automated Workflow Execution**: Enable Claude Code to work autonomously through predefined development phases
2. **Context Preservation**: Maintain project context and current position across extended sessions
3. **Structured Development**: Enforce consistent 6-step workflow with quality gates
4. **Human Oversight**: Provide control points for pausing, monitoring, and steering automation
5. **State Persistence**: Track progress at both project and task levels with resumable automation
6. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in testing, review, and validation at every step

### Secondary Goals  
1. **Reusability**: Create a framework that works across different project types and technologies
2. **Safety**: Operate within isolated environments (git worktrees) to prevent unintended impacts
3. **Flexibility**: Support both automated and manual development modes with seamless transitions
4. **Observability**: Provide comprehensive status reporting and progress tracking
5. **Consistency**: Enforce uniform development practices across all projects

## System Design

### Core Workflow Methodology

The system implements a rigorous 6-step workflow for every development objective, ensuring consistent quality and thorough validation:

#### Universal 6-Step Workflow
1. **Planning**: Context review, task breakdown, risk assessment, approach design, test strategy
2. **Implementation**: Production-quality code development following architecture and standards
3. **Validation**: Compilation check, test execution (unit + integration), manual testing, performance validation
4. **Review**: Self-review, zen methodology comprehensive code review, architectural compliance check
5. **Refinement**: Address review feedback, re-run tests, optimize performance, resolve all issues
6. **Integration**: Final testing, documentation updates, clean commits, progress state updates

#### Quality Gates
Each objective must pass these mandatory gates before completion:
- **Compilation Gate**: Code builds without errors or warnings
- **Test Gate**: All existing tests pass + new tests written with >90% coverage
- **Review Gate**: Code review completed with all critical issues resolved
- **Integration Gate**: Changes integrate cleanly with existing system
- **Documentation Gate**: All changes properly documented
- **Performance Gate**: Performance benchmarks met or justified exceptions

### Architecture Components

#### 1. Command Interface (Slash Commands)
Custom Claude Code slash commands provide user control:
- `/user:project:setup <name>` - Initialize project structure and git worktree
- `/user:project:doctor` - Validate configuration before starting automation  
- `/user:project:start` - Begin automated development cycle
- `/user:project:status` - Display comprehensive progress information
- `/user:project:pause/resume` - Control automation state
- `/user:project:stop` - Clean project completion
- `/user:project:update` - Maintain project and phase state
- `/user:project:phase <action>` - Manage individual phases
- `/user:project:advance` - Force phase progression

#### 2. Phase Definition System
Structured markdown files define project phases with detailed workflow specifications:

```
phases/
├── 01-planning.md      (Requirements, specifications, architecture design)
├── 02-architecture.md  (System design, technology selection, component definition)
├── 03-implementation.md (Feature development, coding, core functionality)
├── 04-testing.md       (Quality assurance, test coverage, bug resolution)
└── 05-deployment.md    (Production preparation, deployment automation)
```

Each phase includes:
- **Status tracking** with timestamps and completion percentages
- **Objectives** with checkbox completion and detailed validation requirements
- **Prerequisites** and dependencies with verification criteria
- **Detailed 6-step workflow** specifications for each objective
- **Quality gates** with specific pass/fail criteria
- **Success criteria** with measurable validation requirements
- **Progress logs** with workflow step tracking and quality gate status
- **Automation instructions** providing specific guidance for Claude Code
- **Phase-specific workflow variations** adapted to phase requirements

#### 3. Comprehensive State Management
Multi-layered state persistence enabling resumable automation:

**Master State** (`.project-state.json`):
```json
{
  "project_name": "my-project",
  "current_phase": "03", 
  "status": "active",
  "automation_active": true,
  "workflow_step": "validation",
  "current_objective": "Business logic API endpoints",
  "quality_gates_passed": ["compilation", "existing_tests"],
  "completed_phases": ["01", "02"],
  "automation_cycles": 47,
  "started": "2025-07-21T09:00:00Z",
  "last_updated": "2025-07-21T15:30:00Z"
}
```

**Phase-Level State**: Individual phase files track:
- Detailed objective completion with timestamps
- Workflow step position for each objective
- Quality gate passage tracking
- Progress notes with validation results
- Review feedback and resolution status

**Workflow State** (`.workflow-state.json`): Current position in 6-step cycle with quality gate status.

#### 4. Automation Engine
Claude Code hooks provide autonomous operation with workflow enforcement:
- **Stop hooks** intercept session endings to continue 6-step workflow
- **PreToolUse hooks** validate operations align with current workflow step
- **PostToolUse hooks** update progress and validate quality gates

### Development Workflow

#### Phase Management
Phases provide structure and checkpoints:
- Each phase defines specific objectives with detailed workflow requirements
- Automation works within current phase boundaries following 6-step methodology
- Phase advancement occurs only when all objectives pass quality gates
- Manual phase control available with validation checks

#### Workflow Step Management  
Each objective progresses through all 6 steps:
- **Planning**: Requirements analysis, task breakdown, approach design
- **Implementation**: Code development following project standards and architecture
- **Validation**: Comprehensive testing (compilation, unit, integration, manual, performance)
- **Review**: Self-review + zen methodology + architectural compliance
- **Refinement**: Issue resolution, optimization, re-testing until all gates pass
- **Integration**: Final validation, documentation, commits, state updates

#### State Synchronization
Continuous state updates ensure workflow consistency:
- Progress tracked at workflow step level within each objective
- Quality gate passage recorded with timestamps and validation results
- Git history provides implementation audit trail
- State enables pause/resume at any workflow step
- Workflow cannot advance until all quality gates pass

## Operation
