# AI Software Project Management System

## Current Project Context

This project contains a comprehensive testing framework and the foundation for an automated phase-driven development system. We've identified a significant gap between documented capabilities and actual implementation, and are now building the missing functionality.

## Project Status

**Phase:** Implementation Phase 2C - Integration (✅ COMPLETED)  
**Last Updated:** 2025-07-23  
**Current Focus:** Full system integration verified. Ready for Phase 3: Testing & Validation

## What Works Currently

✅ **4-Layer Test Framework**
- Unit tests (8 passing, high quality)
- Integration tests with MockClaudeProvider  
- Contract tests with JSON schema validation
- Chaos tests for resilience validation
- Comprehensive test runners and reporting

✅ **Project Organization**
- Clean directory structure following Python best practices
- Documentation organized in docs/
- Scripts organized in scripts/
- Test infrastructure in tests/
- All imports and paths correctly updated

✅ **Logging and Security Infrastructure**
- BasicLogger for structured logging
- LoggedSecureShell for command validation
- Security architecture designed (not fully implemented)

✅ **Project State Management** (Phase 1 COMPLETED)
- StateManager class with atomic operations ✅
- .project-state.json schema design ✅ 
- State transitions and validation ✅
- Comprehensive unit test coverage ✅
- Integration testing verified ✅

✅ **Command Implementation** (Phase 2A COMPLETED)
- All 10 /user:project:* commands rewritten with proper Claude Code syntax ✅
- Commands are now 10-20 line executable triggers (not 300+ line manuals) ✅
- Git worktree operations implemented ✅
- Project structure creation via ProjectBuilder ✅
- Security vulnerabilities fixed ✅

✅ **Claude Code Hook Integration** (Phase 2B COMPLETED)
- PreToolUse hook with workflow enforcement ✅
- PostToolUse hook with progress tracking ✅
- Stop hook with automatic workflow advancement ✅
- WorkflowRules engine for intelligent rule evaluation ✅
- Emergency override support ✅
- Compliance tracking and scoring ✅

## What's Missing (Next Phases)

❌ **Testing & Validation**
- Comprehensive test suite for hooks
- Integration testing of command + hook system
- Performance benchmarking

❌ **Documentation & Polish**
- User guide for workflow system
- Troubleshooting documentation
- Advanced configuration options
- 6-step workflow enforcement

## Current Implementation Plan

See **docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** for complete details.

**Phase 1: State Management Core** (✅ COMPLETED)
1. ✅ Design .project-state.json schema → docs/PROJECT_STATE_SCHEMA.md
2. ✅ Implement StateManager class → src/state_manager.py  
3. ✅ Comprehensive unit test coverage → tests/unit/test_state_manager.py
4. ✅ Integration testing verified

**Phase 2: Command Implementation**
1. Git worktree operations
2. Project structure creation
3. Working /user:project:* commands

**Phase 3: Hook Integration**
1. Research Claude Code hook API
2. Implement workflow automation
3. Create hook files for automation

**Phase 4: Testing & Validation**
1. Comprehensive testing of all components
2. Integration with existing test framework
3. Safety and performance validation

**Phase 5: Documentation & Polish**
1. Update documentation to match reality
2. User experience improvements
3. Advanced features

## Development Guidelines

**Testing Requirements:**
- All new code must have unit tests
- Integration tests for major components
- Use existing 4-layer test framework
- Run tests with: `python tests/runners/test_runner_v2.py`

**Architecture Principles:**
- Incremental implementation with working systems at each phase
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing test framework  
- Atomic operations for state management
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Git Workflow:**
- Feature branches for each major component
- Clean commits with descriptive messages
- Regular integration with main branch

## Key Files and Directories

**Implementation (Phase 1 Complete):**
- `src/state_manager.py` - ✅ Core state management with atomic operations
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE_SCHEMA.md` - ✅ Complete schema documentation
- `tests/unit/test_state_manager.py` - ✅ Comprehensive unit tests
- `src/commands/` - Command implementations (Phase 2)
- `src/hooks/` - Claude Code hooks (Phase 3)

**Existing Infrastructure:**
- `tests/` - Complete 4-layer test framework
- `scripts/logged_secure_shell.py` - Security and logging
- `docs/` - Project documentation
- `project/` - Command templates (to be replaced)

**Configuration:**
- `tests/test_config.yaml` - Test framework configuration
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules (includes test_results/)

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. **Git Operations** - Create src/git_operations.py for worktree management
2. **Project Builder** - Create src/project_builder.py for directory setup
3. **Command Implementation** - Convert template commands to working Python implementations
4. **Command Integration** - Update install.sh and create wrapper scripts
5. **Manual Testing** - Verify all /user:project:* commands work without automation

## Key Insights

- **Phase 1 Success**: StateManager provides reliable, atomic state management with comprehensive validation
- **Phase 2A Success**: Commands transformed from instruction manuals to executable triggers
- **Phase 2B Success**: Hook system enforces workflow with intelligent flexibility
- The existing test framework is high-quality and should be preserved
- Incremental approach is working - solid foundation established for future phases
- Three-layer architecture (Commands → Hooks → StateManager) provides clean separation of concerns
- Security vulnerabilities identified and fixed proactively

## Contact and Context

This project transforms Claude Code into a disciplined development partner through automated phase-driven workflows. The vision is ambitious but achievable through systematic implementation of the missing components.
