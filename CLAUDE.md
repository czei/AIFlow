## Development Guidelines

**Testing Requirements:**
- All new code must have unit tests
- Integration tests for major components
- Use existing 4-layer test framework
- Run tests with: `python tests/runners/test_runner_v2.py`

**Test Project Creation:**
- When testing ProjectBuilder or setup commands, create projects in temporary directories
- Use Python's `tempfile.mkdtemp()` or similar for test projects
- Never commit test project artifacts to the repository
- The .gitignore now excludes common test project patterns (test-*/, *-test/)

**Architecture Principles:**
- Incremental implementation with working systems at each sprint
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing test framework  
- Atomic operations for state management
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Git Workflow:**
- Feature branches for each major component
- Clean commits with descriptive messages
- Regular integration with main branch
