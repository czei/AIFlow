- Commands are now 10-20 line executable triggers (not 300+ line manuals) ✅
- Git worktree operations implemented ✅
- Project structure creation via ProjectBuilder ✅
- Security vulnerabilities fixed ✅

✅ **Claude Code Hook Integration** (Phase 2B COMPLETED)
- PreToolUse hook with workflow enforcement ✅
- PostToolUse hook with progress tracking ✅
- Stop hook with automatic workflow advancement ✅
- WorkflowRules engine for intelligent rule evaluation ✅
- Emergency override support ✅
- Compliance tracking and scoring ✅
- **Phase 3 Addition:** 100% unit test coverage for all hooks ✅

✅ **Testing & Validation** (Phase 3 COMPLETED)
- Test suite improved from 20% → 60% → 75% → 100% pass rate ✅
- Fixed all flaky integration tests ✅
- Proper test isolation implemented ✅
- All 25 tests passing deterministically ✅
- Created 84 new unit tests for hook system ✅
- Achieved 100% test coverage for entire project ✅

## What's Missing (Next Phases)

❌ **Phase 4: Documentation & Polish**
- User guide for workflow system
- Troubleshooting documentation
- Advanced configuration options
- Story lifecycle enforcement
- Performance benchmarking

❌ **Phase 5: Advanced Features**
- Multi-repository support
- Custom workflow definitions
- AI-powered code review integration
- Metrics dashboard

## Current Implementation Plan

See **docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** for complete details.

**Phase 1: State Management Core** (✅ COMPLETED)
1. ✅ Design .project-state.json schema → docs/PROJECT_STATE_SCHEMA.md
2. ✅ Implement StateManager class → src/state_manager.py  
3. ✅ Comprehensive unit test coverage → tests/unit/test_state_manager.py
4. ✅ Integration testing verified

**Phase 2: Command Implementation**
1. Git worktree operations
2. Project structure creation
3. Working /user:project:* commands

**Phase 3: Testing & Validation** (✅ COMPLETED)
1. ✅ Comprehensive testing of all components
2. ✅ Integration with existing test framework
3. ✅ 100% test coverage achieved

**Phase 4: Documentation & Polish**
1. Update documentation to match reality
2. User experience improvements
3. Performance optimization

**Phase 5: Advanced Features**
1. Multi-repository support
2. Custom workflow definitions
3. AI-powered enhancements

## Development Guidelines

**Testing Requirements:**
- All new code must have unit tests
- Integration tests for major components
- Use existing 4-layer test framework
- Run tests with: `python tests/runners/test_runner_v2.py`

**Architecture Principles:**
- Incremental implementation with working systems at each sprint
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing test framework  
- Atomic operations for state management
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Git Workflow:**
- Feature branches for each major component
- Clean commits with descriptive messages
- Regular integration with main branch

## Key Files and Directories

**Implementation (Phase 1 Complete):**
- `src/state_manager.py` - ✅ Core state management with atomic operations
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE_SCHEMA.md` - ✅ Complete schema documentation
- `tests/unit/test_state_manager.py` - ✅ Comprehensive unit tests
- `src/commands/` - Command implementations (Phase 2)
- `src/hooks/` - Claude Code hooks (Phase 3)

**Existing Infrastructure:**
- `tests/` - Complete 4-layer test framework
- `scripts/logged_secure_shell.py` - Security and logging
- `docs/` - Project documentation
- `project/` - Command templates (to be replaced)

**Configuration:**
- `tests/test_config.yaml` - Test framework configuration
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules (includes test_results/)

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. **Git Operations** - Create src/git_operations.py for worktree management
2. **Project Builder** - Create src/project_builder.py for directory setup
3. **Command Implementation** - Convert template commands to working Python implementations
4. **Command Integration** - Update install.sh and create wrapper scripts
5. **Manual Testing** - Verify all /user:project:* commands work without automation

## Key Insights

- **Phase 1 Success**: StateManager provides reliable, atomic state management with comprehensive validation
- **Phase 2A Success**: Commands transformed from instruction manuals to executable triggers
- **Phase 2B Success**: Hook system enforces workflow with intelligent flexibility
- **Phase 3 Complete Success**: 100% test coverage achieved with 84 new unit tests for hook system
- Fixed all flaky tests through proper state isolation and subprocess testing
- The test framework has been enhanced with pytest support and proper test discovery
- Incremental approach has proven successful - each phase builds on solid foundations
- Three-layer architecture (Commands → Hooks → StateManager) provides clean separation of concerns
- Security vulnerabilities identified and fixed proactively
- Test isolation framework prevents state pollution and ensures reliability
